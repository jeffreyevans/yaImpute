Changes in version 1.0-33:

* Modified several url's as needed to adjust to changes in some web addresses.
* Changed reference to original JSS paper to use doi as suggested by Achim Zeileis.
* Changed maintainer to Jeffrey Evans <jeffrey_evans "at" tnc.org> and added him as an author.
* Added code in newtargets() that changes "newdata" to a dataframe if 
it isn't one on input (thanks to Caio Hamamura for the suggestion).

Changes in version 1.0-32:

* Corrected the interface information in yaImpute_init.c so that it matches
the actual arguments of rfoneprox. Thanks to Prof Ripley for finding the error.

* Added an argument to varSelection and grmsd that is passed to impute.yai so that the
method of computing the imputed value can be controlled. 

Changes in version 1.0-31:

* Changed a variable name in one of the ANN routines so that the code can 
compile on Solaris. Removed an unused variable in the ANN routines. Thanks to 
Prof Ripley for finding the error.

Changes in version 1.0-30:

* Removed the c++ "register" keyword from the ann sources as requested by CRAN.
* Added method="gower" for gower distance that allows categorical variables in 
the X data (the Y data are ignored, analogous to method="raw" where the relationship
between the X and Y data are not relevant).
* Fixed a bug in varSelection pointed out by Francisco Mauro.

Changes in version 1.0-27 and 1.0-29:

* Addressed an issue in the ann source code (likely a false positive) found 
by rchk at CRAN.
* Added RegisteredNativeSymbol usage according to best practices
* The error when bootstraping with method="randomForests" is fixed.
* Fixed an error in yai() when it is called by varSelection() using 
yaiMethod="randomForest", thanks to Andrew Haywood.

Changes in version 1.0-25 and 1.0-26:

* Added import directives to meet recent CRAN rules that say that functions 
from default packages other than base which are used in the package
code need to be imported.

Changes in version 1.0-24:

* Changed the examples for several functions so that they run even when dependent
packages are not present.
* Changed package title to comply with CRAN rules
* Changed require to requireNamespace in errorstats.R
* Fixed error in AsciiGridImpute insuring that factors are correctly output
and that the legend is accurate.
* Fixed url to a citation thanks to RForge checks!
* Added the ability to pass ... to impute() it is called by AsciiGridImpute().
* Made several changes to conform to the instructions regarding the use of 
"requireNamespace" for "suggested" packages. 
* Modified how reference observations are delt with when bootstrapping. 
Now, a reference that has been selected more than once due to sampling with 
replacement can not be used to represent itself unless options are used to 
force that behavior. Prior to this change, a reference could be used to represent
itself when it existed more than once in the bootstrap sample causing deflated
error estimates. Thanks to Patrick Fekety for pointing the problem and doing
most of the work that lead to a solution.

Changes in version 1.0-23:

* Added package parallel to the suggested list in DESCRIPTION, issue reported by
RForge checks.
* Fixed a bug in yai() when categorical predictors are used, reported by Nan Pond.
* Fixed a bug in yai() that was revealed when bootstrapping. 
Thanks to Jan Rombouts.
* Enhanced AsciiGridImpute() to trim the number of files being read. 
Thanks to Nicolas Py.

Changes in version 1.0-22:

* Greatly improved the speed of impute.R, thanks to Bastien Ferland-Raymond who 
pointed out the problem. 
* Fixed an error in AsciiGridImpute() pointed out by Nicolas PY.
* Fixed an error in yai() concerning the specification of mtry when 
method="randomForest", thanks to Guy Strickland.

Changes in version 1.0-21:

* Added code to grmsd() so that it "runs" wiht single variables (ie, just one y from lm).
* Added an argument to yai() that allows one to specify a different subset of X-variables
for each Y-variable. 
* Fixed a bug in reporting the results when method="randomForest" and the rfmethod="regression".
* Fixed two long-standing bugs in AsciiGridImpute and AsciiGridPredict. One was
that the output grid headers would not be output correctly when the nodata 
argument was used and the other delt with a problem when predict returned a matrix.
* Modified the examples in AsciiGridImpute so that they use a tempdir() for output files.
* Added the use of grmsd() in the examples in yai().
* Fixed return value in grmsd() when argument rtnVectors is TRUE

Changes in version 1.0-20:

* Added varSelection() to aid in variable selection. A plot function is 
include to aid in understanding the results; bestVars() returns what seem to be
a set of "best" variables for objects created by varSelection().
* Added grmsd() to compute a generalized root mean square error which is a Mahalanobis
distance between observed and imputed. Provides a single score useful for ranking
imputation models and methods (or returns vectors of distances).
* Added rmsd(); it is an alias to rmsd.yai().
* Added method="median" to function impute.
* Added method="msnPP" to function yai to enable using canonical correlation via 
projection pursuit from package ccaPP
* Added ensembleImpute() to get an mean or median imputation for several
separate imputations. Computes the mode for factors.
* Added John Coulston as an author on some of the new functions and the package.
* Added bootstrap= option to yai() so that reference observations can 
be sampled with replacement forming a bootstrap rep.
* Added sampleVars= option to yai() so that X-, Y- or both kinds of variables
can be sampled.
* Added buildConsensus() to find a consensus imputation over several 
reps and forming one yai object. 
* Added (at long last) a predict function.
* Added the ability to specify the scaling values for rmsd.yai and compare.yai
* Modified some help files to improve acknowledgments and cross references.
* Fixed a small typographical error in the help for correctBias(), accomplished 
minor edits to other help files. 
* Added the ability to specify k in function newtargets (how did I miss that?).
* Changed the variable importance score calculation for yaiVarImp()
from "MeanDecreaseGini" to "MeanDecreaseAccuracy" and made it clear in the help file.
* Added function applyMask() that removes (or keeps) reference neighbors that share 
group membership with a target. Thanks to Clara Antón Fernández for suggestions that
lead to this function being added.
* Small update to the COPYRIGHTS file to make clear that Andrew O. Finley wrote
annImpute.cpp

Changes in version 1.0-19:

* Moved COPYRIGHTS to inst/COPYRIGHTS and greatly added detailed information 
to the file.
* Modified DESCRIPTION to note contribution of the authors of ANN (as per 
policy).
* Added a Copyright statement to DESCRIPTION.  
* Added detail to the Description statement in file DESCRIPTION.
* Fixed print.yai.R error when there is only one target and K>1.
* Modified the file handling in AsciiGridPredict (and AsciiGridImpute).
* Fixed a case where a reference picks itself as the second most similar neighbor. This only
happens when there are two or more identical reference observations (thanks to Petteri Packalen).
* Further revision to the ftest to deal with degenerate cases and put in a trap on the use
of method="msn2" when there are too few observations.

Changes in version 1.0-18:

* Added a function (notablyDifferent) to use a consistent method to identify 
observations with large error. 
* Added an function to (plot.notablyDifferent) to plot the data from notablyDifferent().
* Modified the ftest in yai() so that it correctly computes the number of canonical variates.

Changes in version 1.0-17:

* Replaced deprecated calls to sd(<matrix>|<data.frame>) and mean(<matrix>|<data.frame>) with apply().
* Commented out use of cout in ANN routines.
* Added a function (correctBias) to check for bias and correct it by finding different neighbors.
* Added an option to notablyDistant() to compute the threshold using quantile().
* Changed Crookston's email address.

Changes in version 1.0-16:

* Fixed and moved this news files.
* Fixed long standing error in the way Mahalanobis distances are computed
(thanks to Petteri Packalen)
* Fixed the use of "useid" in AsciiGridImpute and modified the help pages
to make it more clear.
* Removed the provisional use of a modified versions of randomForest.default as
the stock version meets the needs. Also removed, for the same reason, a 
modified version predict.cca.
* Removed the long-deprecated "addXlevels" as it is no longer needed with newer 
versions of randomForest.

Changes in version 1.0-15:

* The update to ANN headers were reapplied.

Changes in version 1.0-14:

* Fixed typos in yai.Rd
* Added to the ability to pick neighbors at random among 1:k nearest in
  function foruse().

Changes in version 1.0-13:

* Bug fix in unionDataJoin that effects non-yaImpute uses of this function
* Fixed AsciiGridImpute to better deal with NA's generated when ancillary
  data are being mapped.
* Fixed errorStats to deal with case where rmsd can not be computed due
  to missing data.
* Added drop=FALSE to deal with case where only one variable is left in
  the computations of rmsd after variables with no observed values are removed.
* Fixed some problems in the customized version of randomForest.default to
  comply with current R coding standards.
* Same as above for yaiRFSummary.

is used.
* Improved the help file for AsciiGridImpute/AsciiGridPredict.

Changes in version 1.0-32:

* Jeffrey S. Evans took over package maintenance

Changes in version 1.0-33:

* Fixed "warning: format string is not a string literal (potentially insecure) [-Wformat-security]" in ANN.cpp clang (v 17.0.5) compile under linux Fedora

Changes in version 1.0-34:

* Lila Leatherman made reccomendation to provide an option for retaning the OOB object from a randomForest model. 
  This has been added to the `yai` function as oob = c(FALSE, TRUE)
