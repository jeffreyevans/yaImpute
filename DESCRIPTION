Description: Performs nearest neighbor-based imputation using one or more alternative 
    approaches to processing multivariate data. These include methods based on canonical 
    correlation: analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and a multivariate adaptation 
    of the random forest classification and regression techniques of Leo Breiman and Adele 
    Cutler. Additional methods are also offered. The package includes functions for 
    comparing the results from running alternative techniques, detecting imputation targets 
    that are notably distant from reference observations, detecting and correcting 
    for bias, bootstrapping and building ensemble imputations, and mapping results.
